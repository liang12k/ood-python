Decision-making
===============
"looking for the big simple"
:note: hard to forsee all consequences of design decision
-find alternatives, pros/cons of each choice
-good OOD comes from good technical decision-making process
-more time spent on design --> simplifciation --> reduced development, maintenance costs

example
~~~~~~~
falling back to known technology instead of using new technology
-plan design of pro/con + simplification of task
