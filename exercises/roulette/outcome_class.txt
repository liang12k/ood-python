:class:Outcome - all gambling is based on
==============
encapsulates each outcome
-min. outcomes are 38 numbers, red/black
-paid odds are int
-many instances on :class:Table
-:class:Wheel bins has various outcomes
-room for addt'l complex payout rules (ex: rake, x:# variations)
-handle state of game

amount won
~~~~~~~~~~
multiplication of amount bet and odds (basic)
-other cases: 'rake' where house takes 5% of winnings
-:note: assume it's x:1 payout; denominator is consistently 1

Design decision - Object identity
---------------------------------
design depends on matching :class:Outcome objects
-test objects for equality
-:class:Player placing :class:Bet, held by :class:Table
-:class:Wheel select winning outcomes

equality: :class:Outcome for a bet equal to :class:Outcome contained in wheel spin
-outcome names: each instance has distinct Outcome.name

more than equal: :class:Outcome collection of objects
-create sets,maps where hash codes are used

hash code: every object has a hash code
-unique int (address of obj; summary of bits that make up obj)
-distinct objects have distinct hash codes (allows for same objs by value with diff hash codes)
-each individual :class:Outcome object has a distinct hash code (requires 'equal' test)

layers of meaning: three distinct layers of meaning for 'equality' comparing objects
-attribute equality: __eq__() using == operator
-hash equality: includes attribute equality; __hash__(self)()
-identity: references to same object; 'is' comparison, requires single official source of :class:Outcome

Problem
-------
implement?: hash equality or object identity
-goal: pass equality tests

1. object identity:
   -share same :class:Outcome object throughout application (singleton instance)
    never create addt'l :class:Outcome objects,instances to prevent confusion
    DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle
   -two references to same object will pass any identity test and same hash code
   -singleton instance:
    application has once instance of :class:Outcome shared by
    :class:Wheel, :class:Player, :class:Bets

2. hash equality:
   -instances of :class:Outcome act like they are same object
    same hash value, test true for eqaulity; equal for practical purposes
   -feed to create addt'l :class:Outcome objects as they behave appropriately
   -violate DRY principle: include odds when creating an outcome

ensure sharing single instances of :class:Outcome objects
