Bin builder class
=================
:class:BinBuilder
overview: numerous design considerations for :class:Outcome, :class:Bin, :class:Wheel
	  high-level algorithms to group Outcome objs based on geometry of table

Bin builder overview
--------------------
enumerating each Outcome obj in 38 Bins objs
-most Bin objs contains fourteen individual Outcome objs

Builder class (design pattern)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class used to build instance of another class
-design obj that builds various Bin objs and assigns to :class:Wheel
method that enumerates contents of each of 36 number Bin objs, building individual Outcome instances
assign Outcome objs to Bin objs of Wheel instance
use number of steps to create various Outcome types
depend of :class:Wheel to assign each Outcome obj to correct Bin obj

Roulette outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
geometric rules for determining various Outcome objs
-survey table geometry then develop specific algorithms for each kind of bet
-combinations of individual numbers
-rules apply to number from [1,36] inclusive
-different,simpler set of rules for 0,00
