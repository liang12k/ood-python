:class:Wheel
============
two responsibilities
1. container for :class:Bin objects, picks one random :class:Bin object
2. initialize various :class:Bin objects in standard roulette wheel

Container responsibility
------------------------
collection: :class:Wheel is 38 :class:Bin objs
-tuple: winnng Bin obj: selected by random numeric index
 immutable, sequential collection
 index for various Bin objs
 a. 1-Many: Bin-to-Outcomes
 b. 1-1	  : Outcome-to-Bin

-index values 1-36 become index in respect to their Bin
 :note: Bin index 1 is only bin containing Outcome('1',35)

problem
~~~~~~~
separate indexes for 0,00
-assign Bin obj that has 00 Outcome obj to position 37 (resulting in unique place for all 38 Bin objs)

Random bin selection responsibility
-----------------------------------
random number from 0 to 37 to be used as index
-random module: Random.choice(); random Bin obj from list of Bin objs

testability
~~~~~~~~~~~
difficult to test random numbers
create non-random random number generator
1. design Wheel to accept random number generator inserted by main program
   -testing uses non-random generator
   -real simulation uses proper random generator
2. create subclass of system-supplied random number generator
   override few methods required for testing

Constructing a Wheel
--------------------
each Bin obj has list of Outcome objs
-0,00 Bin obj only have two Outcome objs
-remaining numbers have twelve to fourteen Outcome objs
-deferred binding:
 a. binding delayed until name to class is bound is accessed
    class obj will be available at that time and can be passed to the obj

 b.
    ref: implementations are pre-bound at compile time, there is no run-time penalty to look up an implementation in a data structure as with dynamic binding or using virtual functions
